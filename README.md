My first repository 

Hello Everyone Im Kevin

I am new to the world of coding but I am learning javascript, Python, & C# in the hopes of landing a good software development job
The coding world is new & exciting for me and I know the sky is the limit (because you can build your own virtual sky:)


2022 Update:
I am now more experienced with coding than ever. I manage multiple e-commerce sites built on Magento and I actually apply my coding knowledge to build robot.txt files, update schema for better search results, and help build technical aspects of the site. We are currently working on fixing site speed issues by minifying unused javascript and CSS throughout the site to increase search visisbility and help our entire website get indexed and hold consistent first page keyword rankings.
I am also working on the Google Data Analysis course to further my career and become a SEO Analyst. After I finish this course I plan on taking the Google UX Design course to further my web developement skills and continue to advance my career to the next level.
